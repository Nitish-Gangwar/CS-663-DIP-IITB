We have coded by considering that the YaleB dataset and ORL dataset is kept along with question directory.
For running the code you can directly go to the code file and can run it. On the prompt regarding path please select the (change folder) option.


We have written a single report which contains answers for all the questions and images for the respective questions are kept inside respective question's image folder.

Thank You.
